Collaborations and reliance on other resources: I consulted Summer Sharma for peer critique as we are both doing similar ideas but different locations and different JavaScript libraries (she’s doing MapBox while I’m using p5.js, based on our comfort levels). This collaboration helped me gain insights into different mapping techniques and approaches. A feedback Summer gave is that, instead of attaching a link to a Google Form/Google My Map for people to fill in, she asked me to try to code in a function that allows the live locations to pop up on the spot for the user. I learned from my peer map critique to add a description underneath the title so that users can understand what and who the map is for. This feedback enhanced the user experience and clarity of my map project. I referred to my old assignments especially the function filterFridges() to create emphasis on the different food types people can search on. 

The map is designed with a specific focus on Vancouver residents vulnerable to food insecurity. As a low-income student myself, I relied a lot on these community fridges a lot moving here. It aims to address the challenge of accessing community fridges by providing an interactive platform where users can easily locate these resources and understand what each fridge offers without having to physically visit each location. The map's success lies in its community-oriented approach and user-friendly design, catering to the needs of both those seeking food resources and those contributing to the fridges.

In the design and iteration process, I first identified existing community fridges in Vancouver and then focused on developing a map that enhances accessibility and communication regarding these resources. This involved implementing advanced search and filtering options to allow users to find fridges based on various food group criteria (e.g. vegetables, meat, or bread) as well as incorporating a user contributions feature for adding a community fridge.

The map's interactivity adds understanding by enabling users to search for specific criteria such as food types, opening hours, and proximity. This empowers users to make informed decisions about which fridges to visit and encourages community engagement through user contributions. There is a noticeable gap in the accessibility of community fridge maps, preventing people from adding a community fridge in real-time. The intellectual justifications for these design choices stem from the limitations observed in existing mapping platforms, which often lack detailed information and user engagement features. To improve the map further, incorporating features like a heatmap layer to visualize areas with high concentrations of community fridges or areas of high demand, along with tools for community impact analysis, could enhance its utility and effectiveness.
